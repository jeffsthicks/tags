If $M$ is a manifold, a \emph{surgery of $M$} is the replacement of a $D^{n-k}\times S^k$ with $S^{n-k-1}\times D^{k+1}$. 
Surgery of manifolds is closely tied to cobordisms between manifolds. 
Let $M, N$ be $n$-manifolds. 
A \emph{cobordism} $K: M\rightsquigarrow N$ is a manifold with boundary $\partial K=M\sqcup N$. 
There is an analogous notion of cobordism exists for Lagrangian submanifolds.

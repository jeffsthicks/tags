If $M$ is a manifold, a \emph{surgery of $M$} is the replacement of a $D^{n-k}\times S^k$ with $S^{n-k-1}\times D^{k+1}$. 
Surgery of manifolds is closely tied to cobordisms between manifolds. 
Let $M, N$ be $n$-manifolds. 
A \emph{cobordism} $K: M\rightsquigarrow N$ is a manifold with boundary $\partial K=M\sqcup N$. 
There is an analogous notion of cobordism exists for Lagrangian submanifolds.

One can also discuss Lagrangian cobordisms with both positive and negative ends.

Lagrangian cobordisms give us new examples of exact sequences in the Fukaya category. 
\input{thm_exactSequencesFromCobordisms}
In particular, if $K: (L_0, L_1, L_2)\rightsquigarrow \emptyset$ is a Lagrangian cobordism, then we have an exact triangle
\[L_2\to L_1\to L_0.\]
In contrast to \cref{cor:surgeryExactTriangle}, such a Lagrangian cobordism does not identify \emph{which} exact triangle one has --- it only identifies that you have an exact triangle. 
The iterated mapping cone given in \cref{thm:exactSequencesFromCobordisms} is an example of a twisted complex.

We look at some applications and theorems from symplectic cohomology.

In the setting of subcritical Stein domains ( 
\cref{app:weinsteinConjectureInRn} ), the sublevel sets $X|_{\phi< t}$ 
form 
a nested sequence of Liouville subdomains. One way to prove the vanishing of $\SH(X)$ is to show that the map $\SH(X|_{\phi< t_{i+1}})\to \SH(X|_{\phi< t_{i}})$ is a an isomorphism for all $t_{i} < t_{i+1}$. When the only critical points of $\phi$ contained in $\SH(X|_{\phi < t_0})$ are minima, then $X|_{t_0}$ is a ball, which has vanishing symplectic cohomology.

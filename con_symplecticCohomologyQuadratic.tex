   Let $(X, \lambda)$ be a Liouville domain, and let $\hat X$ be its completion. The goal is to construct a Floer cohomology which witnesses all of the Reeb orbits of $\partial X$. With that in mind, it is natural to study the Hamiltonian Floer cohomology of Hamiltonians $H_t$ with the property that over the symplectization they are of the form 
   \[H|_{\RR\times \partial X}=h(\exp(r))\]
   where $\lim_{r\to\infty} h'(\exp(r))=\infty$. This Hamiltonian witnesses every Reeb orbit with sufficiently large period.

   A problem with this definition is that the Hamiltonian we have chosen is time independent, and so whenever $(\partial X, \alpha)$ has any Reeb orbits, the time-1 orbits of $H$ will necessarily be degenerate (all orbits come in $S^1$ families from reparameterization). The standard work-around is to introduce a small time-dependent perturbation to $H$ in such a way that we can still apply our maximum principle argument. We therefore look at time-dependent Hamiltonians $H_t$ which, outside of a compact set, are of the form $h_t(\exp(r))$, with $\lim_{r\to\infty} h_t(\exp(r))=\infty$ for all $t$. The maximum principle argument from \cref{prp:liouvilleIsGeometricallyBounded} can be made to hold in this setting (Proposition 4.1 \cite{wendlbeginner}).

   One then takes the definition of the symplectic cohomology to be 
   \[\SH(X):=\CF(\hat X, H_t)=\bigoplus_{\gamma\;|\; \dot \gamma= V_{H_t}} \ZZ\langle \gamma\rangle.\]
   with differential given by structure coefficients $\langle d(\gamma_+), \gamma_\rangle$ counting $V_{H_t}$-perturbed pseudoholomorphic cylinders with ends limiting to $\gamma_\pm$.

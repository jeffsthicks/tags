    A set of polyhedra is called a \emph{polyhedral complex} if
    \begin{itemize}
        \item if $\sigma\in P$, then every face $\tau< \sigma$ is also contained in $P$,
        \item For $\sigma_1, \sigma_2\in P$: if $\sigma_1\cap\sigma_2= \tau \neq \emptyset$,then $\tau$ is a face of both $\sigma$ and $\sigma'$. 
    \end{itemize}

    Take $f=q_1+q_2+1$, where $q_1,q_2 \in (\CC^*)^2$. Drawing the image of $V(f)$ under $\Log_t$ gives us the following sequence of images:

\end{figure}
    We call the image of $V(f)$ under the $\Log_t$ map the \emph{amoeba} of $V(f)$, which (in this example) appears to converge to some piecewise linear object.

One viewpoint on mapping cones of cochain  complexes is that they give \emph{deformations} of (direct sums of) objects of our categories. Given a map of cochain complexes $f: A\to B$, the differential on $\cone(f)$ has the form 
\[d_{\cone(f)}=\begin{pmatrix} d_A & 0 \\ 0 & d_B \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0\\ f & 0\end{pmatrix}\]
where the first term is the differential on $A\oplus B[1]$, and the second term ``deforms'' the differential on this chain complex.

Twisted complexes  extend this story in several directions: firstly, we expand the set of deformations so that the objects we consider are chain complexes up to homotopy, and we allow deformations of the product (and not only differential) structure.

There exists an inclusion functor $i:\mathcal C\to \Tw(\mathcal C)$.
We can therefore declare that the triangle $A\to B\to C$ is exact in  $\mathcal A$ is if $C$ is quasi-isomorphic to $\cone(A\to B)$ in the category of twisted complexes.

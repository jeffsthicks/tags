    We prove this in the setting where $\Sigma=\CC$ (this will serve as a local model for the general setting). 
    Consider the space of polynomials of degree $n$ with leading coefficient 1, 
    \[\CC[z]_n:=\{z^n+a_{n-1}z^{n-1}+\cdots + a_1z+a_0\st a_i\in \CC\}\]
    There is a map from $\CC[z]_n\to \Sym^n(\CC)$ which sends each polynomial to its (unordered) set of zeros. This map is a bijection as every set of $n$ points (with possible repetition) in $\CC$ uniquely determines a degree $n$ polynomial with leading coefficient 1.
    The complex structure comes from identifying $\CC[z]_n = \CC^n$.

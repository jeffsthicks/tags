If $\dim_\RR(X)\geq 4$, then we can choose an almost complex structure $J$ so that whenever $p_{01}, q_{01}\in L_0\cap L_1$ are intersections, and $u: [0,1]\times \RR\to X$ is a $J$ holomorphic strip, then the boundary of $u$ is disjoint from a small neighborhood of $L_1\cap L_2$. In particular, $u$ gives a $J$-holomorphic strip with boundary on $L_0, L_1\#_{p_{12}} L_2$.

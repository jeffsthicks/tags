    In the local model at a critical point of $\pi$, projection to the real coordinate can be written in local holomorphic coordinates as 
    \[\Re(\pi)=x_1^2+\ldots x_n^2-y_1^2-\ldots y_n^2.\]
    The downward flow space is parameterized by 
    \[W^-_p=\{x_1=y_1, \ldots, x_n=y_n\}\]
    which is a Lagrangian submanifold for the standard symplectic structure.

 \begin{convention}
We take the following conventions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item There should be self-indexing Morse functions.
\end{itemize}
From this it follows that :
\begin{itemize}
    \item The index of a critical point of a Morse function is the dimension of its downward flow space.
    \item Morse cohomology counts the number negative gradient flow lines.
    \item The identity in Morse cohomology is the minimum of the Morse function.
    \item On a manifold $M$ with boundary, Morse functions $f: M\to \RR$ with outward pointing gradient compute $CM^\bullet(M)$. This is because the downward flow spaces of every critical point are disjoint from the boundary.
    \item The map from $HM^\bullet(M, f)\to H^\bullet(M)$ sends $x\mapsto PD(W^\uparrow(x))$.
\end{itemize}

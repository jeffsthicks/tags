We now visualize the Polterovich surgery for Lagrangian sections of $T^*\RR^n$.
The Lagrangians which we consider are two sections of the cotangent bundle. 
Let $L_1$ be the graph of $d(q_1^2+ \cdots+ q_n^2)$, and let $L_2$ be the graph of $d(-q_1^2-\cdots -q_n^2)$. 
In dimension 2, we can then draw $L_1\# L_2$ and $L_2\# L_1$ as multisections of the cotangent bundle. 
These multisections are sketched in \cref{fig:surgeryDim4}.
Note that one of surgeries creates a Lagrangian which has a ``neck'' visible in the projection to the base of the cotangent bundle.
The other surgery is generically a double-section of the cotangent bundle, except over the fiber of the intersection point where it is instead an $S^1$.

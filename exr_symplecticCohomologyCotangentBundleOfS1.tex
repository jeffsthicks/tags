Consider the space $T^*S^1$, with coordinates $(q, p)$. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Determine all of the time-1 periodic orbits of the Hamiltonian $H=|p|^2$. 
    \item Construct a Hamiltonian $\tilde H$ with the property that 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The non-constant orbits of $H$ are in bijection with the non-constant orbits of $\tilde H$ and;
        \item $\tilde H$ has only 2 constant orbits.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Let $TI(\tilde H)/S^1$ denote the set of time independent orbits of $\tilde H$ up to reparameterization. It is shown in \cite{bourgeois2009symplectic} that there exists a time dependent Hamiltonian $\tilde H_t: T^*S^1\to \RR$ whose
    \begin{itemize}
        \item constant orbits are in bijection with the constant orbits of $\tilde H$ and;
        \item whose non-constant orbits are of the form  $\{\gamma_{\min}\}_{\gamma\in TI(\tilde H)}\cup \{\gamma_{\max}\}_{\gamma\in TI(\tilde H)}$. 
    \end{itemize}
    Furthermore, the homology class of $\gamma_{\min}, \gamma_{\max}$ 
    agree with $\gamma\in TI(\tilde H)$, and there is (in this example) no differential between $\gamma_{\min}, \gamma_{\max}$.
    Using this, compute $\SH(T^*S^1)$ (as an ungraded vector space). 
    \item Compute $H_*(LS^1)$, the homology of the loop space of $S^1$.
    \item Justify why the generators of $H_*(LS^1)$ appear in pairs (just like they do $\SH(T^*S^1)$). 
\end{enumerate}

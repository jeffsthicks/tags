%name:"symplectic form on surfaces"


    Let $(X, g)$ be an oriented surface.
    Then $g$ prescribes a volume form $\omega:=\text{vol}_g\in \Omega^2(X;\RR)$, which is an example of a non-degenerate 2-form. 
    Because $\Omega^3(X;\RR)=0$, it trivially follows that $\omega$ is closed. 
    This example raises the possibility of the same space having many different symplectic forms, as an oriented surface can be equipped with several different metrics.

Suppose additionally that $W^{-1}(c)$ has an $A_1$ singularity (a node) then 
\[\FS_c = D\Coh(\text{pt}) = D\Vect\]
and the generating object is called the \emph{vanishing thimble} associated with the point. So if all critical points of $W$ are more (i.e., $W$ is a Lefschetz fibration), then $\FS(Y, W)$ admits a full exceptional collection. 

If $W$ has isolated singularities, they can be ``Morsified'' by a small perturbation (in the symplectic category). From this, we obtain the following principle:
if $(Y, W)$ is a symplectic Landau-Ginzburg model and $W$ has isolated singularities, then $\FS(Y, W)$ admits a full exceptional collection. 
This tells us that many examples arising from mirror symmetry will \emph{not} have isolated singularities, as their mirror spaces will not have full exceptional collections! However, we still have the following expectations. When $X$ is Fano, and $(Y, W)$ is its mirror, then we expect $W$ will have some isolated singularities, and an additional critical value $c_{\text{Ku}}$ with non-isolated singularities with 
\[\text{Ku}(X) = \FS_{c_{\text{Ku}}}.\]

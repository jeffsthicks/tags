We have a complete classification of surfaces; we can effectively ``draw'' all oriented surfaces. The proof of the classification of surfaces can be stated in terms of \emph{fundamental polygons}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item First, one shows that every surface can be represented by a polygon with edge identifications, 
    \item Then, one shows that there are several ``moves'' on fundamental polygons that modify the combinatorial data of the fundamental polygon but correspond to the same surface,
\end{itemize}

Heegaard diagrams are one way to produce a combinatorial presentation 3-manifold, for which there exist a nice set of moves between diagrams corresponding to the same manifold.

In the setting of surfaces, we have invariants associated to fundamental polygons (the genus, and orientability) which characterize the equivalence classes of fundamental polygons up to ``moves''.
The Heegaard-Floer cohomology is an invariant (constructed using techniques similar to Lagrangian intersection Floer theory) that we can associate to a Heegaard diagram.

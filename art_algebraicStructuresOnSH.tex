Without proof, we describe some of the algebraic structures on the symplectic cohomology. 

First, the construction of the pair of pants product on Hamiltonian Floer cohomology can be extended to give a pair-of-pants product on the symplectic cohomology. This makes $\SH(X)$ into a graded ring. Furthermore, the symplectic cohomology is a ring with unit.

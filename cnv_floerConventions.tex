We take the following conventions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The Floer action functional is 
    \[A_{H_t}(\gamma):=-\int_\gamma \lambda+ H_t dt\]
    giving us the Floer equation:
    \[\partial_su +J_t \partial_t -X_{H_t}\]
    The input end of a Floer trajectory is the limit as $s\to\infty$, and the output end is the end as $s\to-\infty$. In this convention, Floer trajectories are gradient flow lines of the Floer action. The differential on symplectic cohomology is given by counting \emph{downward} flow lines.
\end{itemize}

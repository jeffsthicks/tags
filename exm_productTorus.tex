    The \emph{product torus} is the Lagrangian torus in $\CC^n$ given by 
    \[T^n=\{|z|\in \CC^n\;\text{ such that }\; |z_i|=1\}.\]
    To prove that this is a Lagrangian submanifold we first observe that whenever $L_1\subset (X_1, \omega_1)$ and $L_2\subset (X_2, \omega_2)$ are Lagrangian submanifolds, then $L_1\times L_2\subset (X_1\times X_2, \omega_1+\omega_2)$ is a Lagrangian submanifold as well. 
    The product torus comes from taking the product of circles $S^1\subset \CC$, which are Lagrangian submanifolds from \cref{exm:curvelagrangian}.

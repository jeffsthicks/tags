    The symplectic fibration which we will use as a running example through this section is 
    \begin{align*}
        \pii:\CC^2\to& \CC\\
        (z_1, z_2)\mapsto& z_1z_2.
    \end{align*}
    This has one critical value at $z_1z_2=0$.
    The generic fiber $\pii^{-1}(z)$ is symplectomorphic to $(\CC^*)^2$.
    At the origin, this degenerates to the union of two complex lines, $\CC_{z_1=0}\cup \CC_{z_2=0}$.
    \Cref{fig:modelsingularity} is a drawing of this Lefschetz fibration.

There exists a \snip{standard model}{lem:straightening} of two Lagrangian submanifolds intersecting transversely at a point. Therefore, it suffices to construct a Lagrangian surgery neck for the standard intersection neighborhood $X=\CC^n$, $L_1=\RR^n$ and $L_2=\jmath\RR^n$.
We start by picking a \emph{surgery profile curve},  
\begin{align*}
      \gamma: [-R, R] \to& \CC\\
      t\mapsto& (a(t)+\jmath b(t))
\end{align*}
with the property that $a(t), b(t)$ are non-decreasing, and there exists a value $t_0$ so that 
\begin{itemize}
      \item  $\gamma(t)=t$ for $t< t_0$, and
      \item  $\gamma(t)=\jmath t$ for $t>t_0$.
\end{itemize}
We denote the are bounded between the real axis, imaginary axis, and curve $\gamma$ by $\lambda$.
An example is drawn in \cref{fig:polterovichSurgeryProfile}.
\input{fig_polterovichSurgeryProfile}
This data provides a construction for the Lagrangian surgery neck:
\[
	L_1\#_\gamma L_2:=\left\{(\gamma(t)\cdot x_1,\ldots,  \gamma(t)\cdot x_n) \text{ such that } x_i \in \RR^n,t\in \RR, \sum_{i} x_i^2=1\right\}.
\]
Note that when $t < t_0$ this parameterizes $(\RR\setminus B_r(0))\subset \CC^n$, and when $t > t_0$ the chart parameterizes $(\jmath \RR \setminus B_r(0))\subset \CC^n$. 
Therefore, this construction satisfies the condition that the surgery Lagrangian agrees with the surgery components outside of a small neighborhood of the surgery point.
This Lagrangian has the topology of $S^{n-1}\times \RR$, which is the local model for the connect sum $\RR^n\#_0\RR^n$.


Then \cref{prp:polterovichSurgery} follows by taking $L_1\#_\gamma L_2$ for any suitable choice of $\gamma$.

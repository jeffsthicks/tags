In this reading group, we'll discuss mirror symmetry for Fano varieties. 

In mirror symmetry, we have pairs of Calabi-Yau manifolds $X, Y$ whose symplectic and algebraic invariants are equivalent. A precise version of this statement is the homological mirror symmetry conjecture:
\input{fig_HmsDiagram}

When $X$ is \emph{Fano}, the mirror $Y = (Y, W)$ is a Landau-Ginzburg model, where 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $Y$ is an algebraic variety over $\CC$ 
    \item $W: Y \to \CC$ is a holomorphic function satisfying additional conditions that we will discuss later.
\end{itemize}
In this case, our equivalence of invariants needs to be slightly modified:

Where $\FS(Y, W)$ is the Fukaya-Seidel category, and $\Sing(Y, W)$ is the category of singularities. 
In the literature, there is more work in the direction of $D\Fuk(X) \leftrightarrow D\Sing(Y, W)$, but in this reading group, we will focus on $D\Coh(X)\leftrightarrow D\Sing(Y, W)$. 
We call $D\Coh(X)$ the \emph{B}-side, while $D\FS(Y, W)$ is the \emph{A}-side.

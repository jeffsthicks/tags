    Let $(X,  \omega=d\lambda)$ be an exact symplectic manifold.
    An \emph{exact Lagrangian submanifold} is a $n$-dimensional submanifold $L\subset X$ with a choice of primitive $f: L\to \RR$ so that $df=\lambda|_L$. In particular, $\omega|_L=0$ so $L$ is a \snip{Lagrangian submanifold}{def:lagrangianSubmanifold}.

\snip{When studying symplectic manifolds}{art:mosersTheorem}, we saw that symplectic manifolds are locally modeled on the standard symplectic space and therefore admit no local invariants. 
We now show that the cotangent bundle of a manifold $Q$ gives a better local model for symplectic manifolds.
In the cotangent bundle, $Q\subset T^*Q$ is a half-dimensional submanifold on which the canonical symplectic form vanishes.
Additionally, $Q$  canonically determines the symplectic structure on $T^*Q$.
Lagrangian submanifolds are submanifolds of $X$ which behave like the zero section $Q\subset T^*Q$.
\input{def_lagrangianSubmanifold}
A Lagrangian manifold lies parallel to the symplectic form everywhere.
The requirement that the dimension of $L$ is half of  $\dim(X)$ is non-arbitrary --- this is the maximal dimension on which the symplectic form can vanish (due to the non-degeneracy of $\omega$).

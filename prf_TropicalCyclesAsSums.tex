    Every $q\in Q$ has a neighborhood $\text{Star}_Q(p)$ which looks like a fan. For any fan $P$, we define its splitting dimension $\dim_s(P)$ to be the maximum $k$ so that 
    \[P=\sum P_i\]
    where the $P_i$ have at least $k$-dimensional translation invariance. We then define $\dim_s(q):= \dim_s(\text{Star}_Q(p)$. 
    The proof then proceeds by removing first the star fans of points with star fan dimension 0, and then proceeding through the tropical subvariety.

Now that we have a geometric description of $L_1\#_\lambda L_2$, we discuss what object it represents in the Fukaya category. We restrict ourselves to $\dim_\RR(X)=2$ so that we may draw pictures. However, the pictures are only for intuition (and in fact the sketch of proof we give only work when $\dim(X)\geq 4$).

Let $L_0$ be some test Lagrangian, which intersects both $L_1$ and $L_2$ as in \cref{fig:roundingCorner}. If the surgery neck is chosen to lie in a neighborhood disjoint from the intersections  $L_0\cap (L_1\cup L_2)$, then these intersections are in bijection with the intersections $L_0\cap (L_1\# L_2)$. Therefore $\CF(L_0, L_1\# L_2)=\CF(L_0, L_1)[1]\oplus \CF(L_, L_2)$ as vector spaces.
\input{fig_roundingCorner}
 The intuition from \cite{fukaya2007lagrangian} is that there is a bijection between certain holomorphic triangles with boundary on $L_0, L_1, L_2$ which passes through the intersection point $p_{12}$, and holomorphic strips with boundary on $L_0$ and $L_1\# L_2$. Since holomorphic triangles contribute to the $\emprod^3$ structure coefficients, and strips to the differential, it is reasonable to hope that we can state a relation between $L_1, L_2,$ and $L_1\#L_2$ as objects of the Fukaya category.


First, we observe that the intersection point $p_{12}$ determines a morphism in $\hom(L_2, L_1)$. Since we've assumed that $L_1$ and $L_2$ intersect at only one point, we know that $\emprod^1(p_{12})=0$. We can therefore form the twisted complex $\cone(p_{12})$. We now provide justification for why this is isomorphic to $L_1\# L_2$.

We have already observed that for our test Lagrangian $L_0$ we had an isomorphism of vector spaces between $\hom(L_0, L_1)\oplus \hom(L_0, L_2)$ and $\hom(L_0, L_1\#_\lambda L_2)$. The differential on $\hom(L_0, L_1\#_\lambda L_2)$ comes from counting holomorphic strips, which we break into two types: those which avoid a neighborhood of the surgery neck, and those which pass through the surgery neck.

The more difficult portion is to understand the strips which pass through the neck.
\input{thm_roundingCorner}
In fact, \cite{fukaya2007lagrangian} proves the above statement in much greater generality than we state here. The condition that $\dim(X)\geq 4$ can already be seen in in \cref{fig:roundingCorner}. Observe that if we have a pseudoholomorphic triangle whose boundary passes through the point $p_{12}$ in the wrong way, that there is no corresponding pseudoholomorphic strip with boundary on $L_0$ and $L_1\# L_2$.
Ignoring the potential complications in the definition of the Fukaya category, we obtain:

Let $L_1, L_2\subset X$ be two Lagrangian submanifolds intersecting transversely at a single point $p$. 
Then there exists a Lagrangian submanifold $L_1\#_p L_2\subset X$ which
\begin{itemize}
        \item topologically is the connect sum of $L_1$ and $L_2$ at $p$. 
        \item Agrees with $L_1\cup L_2$ outside of a small neighborhood of $p$ in the sense that 
        \[L_1\#_p L_2|_{X\setminus U}=L_2\cup L_2|_{X\setminus U}.\]
\end{itemize}

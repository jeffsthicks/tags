    A Liouville domain is a pair $(X,\lambda)$, where
    \begin{itemize}
       \item $X$ is a $2n$-manifold with boundary $\partial X$ and,
       \item $\lambda\in \Omega^1(X, \RR)$ is a one form on $\Omega^1(X, \RR)$ so that $\omega=d\lambda$ is a symplectic form for $X$.
    \end{itemize}
 To this data we can associate a \emph{Liouville vector field} $Z$ defined by the property $\iota_Z\omega= \lambda$.
 We require that this vector field transversely points outward along $\partial X$.

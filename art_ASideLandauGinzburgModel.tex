On this side of the mirror, $Y$ will be a K\"ahler manifold, along with a holomorphic function $W: Y \to \CC$ which is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Proper (or controlled at $\infty$ in the fiber directions)
    \item A fibration near $\infty$ or has smooth fibers.
\end{itemize}
The objects of the Fukaya-Seidel category $\FS(Y, W)$ are Lagrangian submanifolds $L \subset Y$ such that $W|_L$ is a fibration over $\RR_+$ outside of a compact set.

To take the Lagrangian intersection Floer cohomology between two such Lagrangians, we need to perturb the Lagrangians at infinity; the perturbation we take will rotate one Lagrangian at infinity. 
As a vector space, $\hom(L, K) = \CC(\langle L \cap \phi(K)\rangle)$.

The differential and product structure on hom-spaces is given by counts of pseudo-holomorphic disks.

    The idea of proof is to observe that every exact triangle in the homotopy category is homotopic to one of the form $A\xrightarrow{f} B \to \cone(f)$, which is an exact sequence of chain complexes. The long exact sequence of cohomology groups arising from the snake lemma then proves the proposition.

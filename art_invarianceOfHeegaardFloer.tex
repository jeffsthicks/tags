The proof of this theorem is beyond the scope of these notes. However, we can outline some of the steps in the proof. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that a similar theorem to \cref{thm:heegaardMoves} holds for pointed Heegaard diagrams.
    \item Invariance of $\HHeF(\Sigma_g, \underline \alpha, \underline \beta, z)$ under isotopies of almost complex structure. 
    \item Invariance of $\HHeF(\Sigma_g,\underline \alpha, \underline \beta,z)$ under isotopies which do not create/destroy critical points. This can be reduced to the previous step by pulling back the almost complex structure along the isotopy.
    \item  Invariance of $\HHeF(\Sigma_g,\underline \alpha, \underline \beta,z)$ under isotopies which do not create/destroy critical points: these isotopies can always be taken to be Hamiltonian isotopies of the Lagrangian $L_{\underline \alpha}$. 
    \item Invariance of $\HHeF(\Sigma_g,\underline \alpha, \underline \beta,z)$ under stabilizations: see \cref{exr:invarianceOfHHF}.
    \item Invariance of $\HHeF(\Sigma_g,\underline \alpha, \underline \beta,z)$: by far, the trickiest portion of the proof. This requires looking at the product structure on Lagrangian intersection Floer cohomology.
\end{enumerate}

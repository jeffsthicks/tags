    A \emph{Stein manifold} is a complex manifold $X$ which admits a proper embedding into $\CC^N$ with $N$ sufficiently large; therefore $X$ is a symplectic manifold with symplectic form $\omega_{\CC^N}|_X$. 
    On $\CC^n$ we have the function $\phi=|z|^2:\CC^n\to \RR$ which is exhausting and strictly plurisubharmonic. The symplectic form on $\CC^n$ can be written as $dd^c\phi$. By restricting $\phi$ to $X$, we obtain a primitive $d^c\phi|_X$ for $\omega|_X$, which makes $X$ a Liouville manifold. In particular, every affine variety is an example of a Liouville manifold.

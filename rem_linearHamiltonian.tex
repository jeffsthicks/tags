Observe that the level sets of a linear Hamiltonian are  $\{r\}\times M$. The Hamiltonian vector field therefore can be restricted to a vector field on the contact manifold $M$. It is not a surprise that the $m V_\alpha$ and Hamiltonian vector field $H_V$ agree:
\begin{align*}
    \iota_{i_* m V_\alpha}\omega=& d(\exp(r) \alpha )(m V_\alpha)\\
     =&(\exp(r) dr \wedge d\alpha - \exp(r) d\alpha) (m V_\alpha)\\
    =&- m \cdot \exp(r)dr = dH^m
\end{align*}
Therefore, the time one Hamiltonian orbits of $H$ correspond to the time $m$ Reeb orbits of $V_\alpha$; by studying Hamiltonian Floer theory on the symplectization $\RR\times M$ we obtain some understanding of the Reeb dynamics of $(M, \alpha)$.

Alternatively, if $m$ is not a period of some Reeb orbit, Then $\RR\times M$ has no time one orbits for the linear Hamiltonian of slope $m$.

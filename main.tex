Symplectic snippets is my effort to organize some of my seminar notes into something outward facing. 

One day, a better index page will go here. Until then, here are a couple of seminar notes which may be of interest to you!

\begin{itemize}
    \item \snip{An introduction to symplectic geometry}{art_basicSymplectic}
    \item \snip{A survey of some of the ways exact sequences appear in symplectic geometry}{art_exactSequencesInSymplecticGeometry}
    \item \snip{A very brief introduction to Heegaard-Floer theory}{art_heegaardFloer}
    \item \snip{An introduction to Symplectic cohomology}{art_symplecticCohomologyExposition}
\end{itemize}

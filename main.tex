\emph{Symplectic snippets} is a proof-of-concept for organizing some of my mathematical notes on symplectic geometry. It was initially put together for the PIMS Summer School on Floer Homotopy theory. 

Notes are written as whole articles in LaTeX and then processed into mathematical tags -- snippets -- which can be individually referenced by other articles. Snippets can also process tikz code into SVG files for viewing through your browser. LaTeX code for any snippet can be accessed through the menu on the right. 

The code for creating this webpage can be

Here are a few introductory articles which were written with this platform.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \snip{An introduction to symplectic geometry}{art_basicSymplectic}
    \item \snip{Basics on Lagrangian submanifolds}{art_lagrangianSubmanifolds}
    \item \snip{Seminar notes on Tropical Chow groups}{art_tropicalGeometrySeminarOutline}
    \item \snip{A survey of some of the ways exact sequences appear in symplectic geometry}{art_exactSequencesInSymplecticGeometry}
    \item \snip{A very brief introduction to Heegaard-Floer theory}{art_heegaardFloer}
    \item \snip{An introduction to Symplectic cohomology}{art_symplecticCohomologyExposition}
\end{itemize}

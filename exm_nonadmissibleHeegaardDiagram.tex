    We look at the example of $M=S^2\times S^1$. Observe that $S^2=D^2\cup_{S^1} D^2$, so we can write $M=D^2\times S^1 \cup_{\Sigma_1} D^2\times S^1$. 
    The Heegaard diagram $(\Sigma_1, \alpha, \beta)$ consists of a torus with two meridional cycles.

    If the diagram is chosen so that $\alpha, \beta$ are disjoint, then the Lagrangian intersection Floer cohomology $\HF(\alpha, \beta)$ vanishes.

    However, if the diagram is chosen so that $\alpha, \beta'$ intersect transversely, the Lagrangian intersection Floer cohomology (with $\ZZ/2\ZZ$ coefficients) is $\ZZ/2\ZZ\oplus \ZZ/2\ZZ$. Note that $\beta'$ can be chosen so that it is Hamiltonian isotopic to $\beta$.
    
    The discrepancy between these two answers comes from the non-convergence of the homotopy between the composition of continuation maps  
    \[f\circ g:\CF(\alpha, \beta')\to \CF(\alpha, \beta) \to \CF(\alpha, \beta')\]
    \[\id: \CF(\alpha, \beta')\to \CF(\alpha, \beta')\]
    over $\ZZ/2\ZZ$ coefficients. The presence of an annulus between $\alpha, \beta$ is the culprit for the non-convergence.

    One can make the quantities converge by using \snip{Novikov coefficients}{def:novikovRing}  instead of $\ZZ/2\ZZ$ coefficients. In that setting, the differential in \cref{fig:nonadmissibleHeegaardDiagram} will be exact unless the areas of the two strips agree --- that is, the Lagrangians $\alpha, \beta$ are Hamiltonian isotopic.

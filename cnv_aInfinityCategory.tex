The choice of convention $m^k:\hom(A_{k-1}, A_k)\otimes \cdots \otimes \hom(A_0, A_1)\to \hom(A_0, A_k)[2-k]$ is designed to be compatible with the convention chosen for composition of morphisms. That is, given $f: A_0\to A_1$ and $g:A_1\to A_2$, our product convention matches the composition convention  $m^2(g, f)= g\circ f: A_0\to A_2$.

For computing the sign of an $A_\infty$ algebra, we will use the convention $\clubsuit(\underline x,k_1):= k_1+\sum_{j=1}^{k_1} \deg(x_j)$.

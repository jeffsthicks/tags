    We identify the symmetric product $\Sym^2(\CP^1)$ with $\CP^2$. To each point in $\CP^2$ we can associate a degree 2 homogenous polynomial in 2-variables:
    \[(z_0:z_1:z_2)\mapsto z_0 s^2 + z_1 st + z_2 t^2\]
    We then factor the polynomial as
    \[( z_0 s^2 + z_1 st + z_2 t^2)=(y_0 s + y_1 t)\cdot (x_0 s + x_1 t)\]
    This gives us a bijection between the points of $\CP^2$ and $\Sym^2(\CP^1)$. 
    \[(z_0:z_1:z_2)\mapsto [(x_0:x_1), (y_0,y_1)]\]
    
    Observe that the moment polytope of $\CP^1\times \CP^1$ is the square given by 
    \[\text{Convex Hull}((0,0), (0,1), (1, 0), (1, 1)),\]
    while the moment polytope of $\CP^2$ is given by the convex hull of
    \[\text{Convex Hull}((0,0), (0,1), (1,1)).\]
    There is map from the first moment polytope to the second (given by ``folding'' along the diagonal) which is 2-1 away from the diagonal (and 1-1 along the diagonal), allowing us to see the symmetric product on the level of moment polytopes.

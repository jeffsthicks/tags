        %Two Definitions of Symplectic Cohomology
    We now give two different constructions of the symplectic cohomology. In both constructions, it is necessary to deal with the non-compactness of the space $\check X$.
    The first defines the symplectic cohomology as the Floer cohomology of a Hamiltonian whose slope increases along the symplectization coordinate to infinity. The second defines the symplectic cohomology as the limit of Floer cohomology of linear Hamiltonians, where the limit is taken over increasing slopes.

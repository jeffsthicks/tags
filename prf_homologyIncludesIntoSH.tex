    Let $m_0$ be the minimal period of a Reeb orbit in $(\partial X, \alpha)$. Pick a slope $0< m< m_0$, and consider a linear Hamiltonian $H^m$ which is $C^2$ small on $X$. Then the only orbits for $H^m$ will be the constant orbits, and there is a quasi-isomorphism of chain complexes between $\CF(\hat X, H^m_t)$ and the Morse complex $CM^\bullet(\hat X, H^m_t)$ sending each constant orbit to its associated critical point of $H^m_t$. Since $H^m$ has gradient which points outward along the boundary of $X$, this is a valid Morse function for computing the Morse cohomology of $X$.

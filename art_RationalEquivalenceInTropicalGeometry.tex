\input{def_TropicalRationalEquivalence}
If you're familiar with rational equivalence in algebraic geometry, the main difference is that we ask the cycle $Y$ to be a subvariety of $X$. Originally, the definition used that $Y$ was a subset of $X$, but unfortunately this definition is not compatible with pushforward. The belief is that the definition of tropical rational function is too rigid (so our definition for tropical rational equivalence) is a bit more flexible. 
\input{def_TropicalChowGroup}
     Let $Q\subset Q\times \RR$. Let $\phi_p$ be the pullback of $\max(x, p')$. 
    Then $F_p=\mathrm{Div}(\phi\cdot F)\subset Q\times \{Q\}\cong Q$
Given $P_1, 2\in Q$ we say that the are $\sim^\RR$ if there exists a cycle $F$ and points $q_1, q_2\in \RR$ so that $P_i=F_{q_i}$.

\begin{remark}
    Observe that if $R\subset P$ has $R\sim^b 0$ and $g: P\to Q$ is a map of tropical varities that $g_*Z\sim^b0$. However, consider the morphism 
    this gives an example of $Z\sim 0$ but $f_*Z\not\sim 0$.

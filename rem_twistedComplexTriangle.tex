There is a relation between exact triangles in $A_\infty$ categories and the $m^3$ product operation. Given $A\xrightarrow{f}B \xrightarrow{g}C\xrightarrow{h}A[1]$ an exact triangle, where $f, g, h$ are chain maps, with the additional assumption that 
\begin{align*}
    \emprod^2(g, f)=0&& \emprod^2(f, h)=0 && \emprod^2(h, g)=0.
\end{align*}
Then we have  maps between $C$ and the twisted cone by 
\begin{align*}
    C\xrightarrow{h} \cone(f:A\to B)&& \cone(f:A\to B) \xrightarrow{g} C.
\end{align*} 
Now, $\emprod^2_{Tw}(h, g)=\emprod^3(g,f,h)_{\mathcal A}$, which is the identity in the homology category.

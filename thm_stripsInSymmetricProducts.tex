    Given a holomorphic strip $u\in \mathcal M(x, y)$ there exists a $g$-branched cover
    $\pi: \hat D\to D$ 
    and a holomorphic map from $\hat u: \hat D \to \Sigma_g$ so that for all $z\in D$, 
    \[u(z)=[(\hat u(z_1), \hat u(z_2), \cdots , \hat u(z_g)])\]
    where $\{z_1, \ldots, z_g\}\in \pi^{-1}(z)$.

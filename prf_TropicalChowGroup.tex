    Suppose that $P_1\sim^\RR P_2$. Then there exists $F\subset Q\times \RR$ with $F_{q_i}=P_i$. 

    Take $R=F$, and define $\phi:=\pi^*\psi$. We see that $(\pi_Q)_* (\pi^*(\psi^*\psi)\cdot F)=P_1-P_2$. 

    NOw suppose instead that $P_1\sim^b P_2$. Then there exists $R$ and $\phi\in \mathcal K_R$ such that $f_*(\div(\phi))=P_1-P_2$. 
    Tke $F:=(f\times \id)_* (\text{graph}(\phi))$. Cruicially, the function $\phi$ is bounded so that the intersection with a sufficiently large slice is empty

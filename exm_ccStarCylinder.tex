    An example that will be especially relevant later is $(\CC^*)^n$.
    We will equip this with a different symplectic form than the one inherited as a subset of $\CC^n=\RR^{2n}$.
    Since $(\CC^*)^n$ is a group, it is natural to ask for a symplectic form on $(\CC^*)^n$ which is invariant under the group action. 
    The symplectic form 
    \[
        \omega=\frac{1}{2\pi} d(\log |z|)\wedge d\theta
    \]
    gives an example of such a symplectic form.
When $n=1$, then this is the area form on $(\CC^*)$ which embeds into three dimensional space as an infinitely long cylinder, as drawn in \cref{fig:ccStarCylinder}.

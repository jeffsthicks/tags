The goal of this note is to 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Define tropical rational equivalence (this works in general, not just in $\RR^n$)
    \item Study Chow group of $\RR^n$
\end{enumerate}

\input{def_TropicalCartierDivisor}
Recall that $\mathcal K^*_X$ is the ring of tropical rational function \cref{def:TropicalRationalfunction}.
To each tropical Cartier divisor we can construct an associated Weil divisor: take the graph of $\phi$, which is a polyhedral complex; extend this to a balanced graph by adding in weighted edges going to the tropical boundary.

From now on, everything happens in $\RR^n$. A map $f: (Q\subset \RR^n)\to (P\subset \RR^m)$ is a morphism of cycles if it is a map of polyhedral complexes which preserves the affine structure. From this we obtain the following:

\begin{definition}{stable intersection}
    Let $X, Y$ be tropical intersection. The stable intersection is defined by $X\cdot Y=\lim_{\eps\to 0} X\cap (Y+\eps v)$ over all intersections of $X, Y+\eps v$ which are transverse. 
\end{definition}
Outside of the setting of $\RR^n$, it is not possible to define this intersection using this formula. We can define (generally) the intersection $\mathrm{Div}(\phi)\cdot Z$, but that is it.

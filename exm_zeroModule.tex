Let $\mathcal A$ be an $A_\infty$ category. We can define the zero module $M$ which has the property that for all $A\in \mathcal A$, our module assigns $M(A)=0$. As a result, the composition maps $m^{1|k}$ all vanish. This trivially satisfies the quadratic $A_\infty$ module relations.

While this appears to be a artificial example, it is generally desirable to have a zero object in your category, and there is no reason a priori for your original $A_\infty$ category $\mathcal A$ to have a zero object. For the example we are interested--- the Fukaya category--- there is no ``zero'' Lagrangian submanifold.

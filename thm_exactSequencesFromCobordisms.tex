Let $L_0, \ldots L_k\in \Fuk(X)$ be Lagrangian submanifolds, and suppose there exists a monotone Lagrangian cobordism $K: (L_0, \ldots, L_k)\rightsquigarrow \emptyset$. Then there exists an iterated cone decomposition in $\text{mod}-\Fuk(X)$,

where each triangle in the diagram an exact triangle, $C_0=0$, and $C_k=k$.

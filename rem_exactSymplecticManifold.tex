In some ways, Liouville domains are the ``simplest'' symplectic manifolds to study. While the presence of boundary on $X$ may seem problematic, this is more than compensated by the fact that $X$ is exact. This is an honest trade-off: by Stoke's theorem, there are no closed exact symplectic manifolds.

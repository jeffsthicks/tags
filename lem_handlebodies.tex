    Let $U$ be a 3-manifold with boundary. $U$ is a handlebody if and only if there exists a Morse function $f: U\to \RR$ whose 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Gradient $\nabla f$ points outward along the boundary of $U$;
        \item $f$ has only critical points of index $0$ and $1$.
    \end{itemize}

    Let $V_0$ and $V_1$ be closed connected $n$ manifolds with volume forms $\Omega_0$ and $\Omega_1$.
     Suppose that they have the same total volume,  that is 
    \[\int_{V_0} \Omega_0 = \int_{V_1} \Omega_1.\]
    Let $\phi_0: V_0\to V_1$ be a diffeomorphism.
    Then $\phi_0$ is isotopic to a volume preserving diffeomorphism $\phi_1$; that is
    \[\phi_1^*\Omega_1=\Omega_0.\]

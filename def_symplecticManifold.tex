 A \emph{symplectic manifold} is a pair $(X,  \omega)$ where $X$ is a smooth manifold of dimension $2n$ equipped with a \emph{symplectic form} 
\[\omega\in \Omega^2(X; \RR).\]
which is closed (i.e. \(d\omega=0\)) and at each point $x\in X$ makes the pair $(T_xX, \omega_x)$ a \sref{def:symplecticVectorSpace}.

%define Reeb Orbit
A Reeb orbit is a map $\gamma: \RR/\ell\ZZ\to M$ with $\frac{d}{dt}\gamma = R$. Unlike the setting of Hamiltonian Floer theory, we do not restrict ourselves to time-one orbits. We have a contact-version of the Arnold conjecture.
\input{cnj_weinsteinConjecture}
Since we do not restrict ourselves to time one-orbits, if there is an orbit, there are an infinite number of orbits (by considering their multiple covers). Even when one considers orbits up to multiplicity, an infinite number of orbits can occur.
\input{exm_reebOrbits}


In \cref{exm:reebOrbits} we have an uncountable number of orbits, but the set of periods of these orbits is only countable.  Given a Reeb orbit $\gamma$, let $\ell(\gamma)$ denote its period.

While the Weinstein conjecture is stated in terms of contact geometry, there is a standard method to translate questions in contact geometry to questions in symplectic geometry.

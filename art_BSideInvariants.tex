\input{def_SemiOrthogonalDecomposition}

When $X$ is Fano, typically $D\Coh(X)$ admits a semi-orthogonal decomposition \cref{def:SemiOrthogonalDecomposition}
    \[D\Coh(X) = \langle \mathcal{C}_1, \cdots \mathcal{C}_n\rangle\]

\input{exm_AVarietyWithNoFullExceptionalCollection}

When we don't have a full exceptional collection, we can try to build one as best as we can and look at what is left. Typically, we have a semi-orthogonal decomposition 
\[D\Coh(X) = \langle \text{Ku}(X), \mathcal{C}_1, \ldots, \mathcal{C}_n\rangle\]
where $\mathcal{C}_i = D\Coh(\bullet)$, and a larger part $\text{Ku}(X)$, which is often called the \emph{Kuznetsov component} of $D\Coh(X)$. 
Often, this Kuznetsov component contains information about the birational geometry of $X$. It can also reveal hidden relationships, e.g., it may be that $D\Coh(X) \neq D\Coh(X')$, but we have $\text{Ku}(X) = \text{Ku}(X')$.

	Let $\Sigma$ be a symplectic manifold with $\dim_\RR(\Sigma)=2$. Let $L_0, L_1\subset \Sigma$ be two Lagrangian submanifolds which intersect transversely at points $p_i$.  
	Show that there exists a Lagrangian submanifold $L'\subset X$ which agrees with $L_0, L_1$ outside a small neighborhood of the $p_i$: 
	\[L'\setminus \left(\bigcup_{i} B_\epsilon(p_i)\right)=(L_0\cup L_1) \setminus \left(\bigcup_{i} B_\epsilon(p_i)\right).\]

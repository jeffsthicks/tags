In order to obtain a replacement for the symplectic form providing a bound on the energy of holomorphic strips, we need to work a little bit harder. The key insight is that there is a dictionary between holomorphic strips in the symmetric product and maps from more-complicated domains to the surface.

\input{prp_intersectionsInSymmetricProducts}
This means that we can understand the intersections between our Lagrangians $L_{\underline \alpha}, L_{\underline \beta}$ in terms of the intersections between the collection of cycles. Remarkably, we can also understand the holomorphic strips between the intersections points by looking at data on $\Sigma_g$. 
\input{thm_stripsInSymmetricProducts}
With this relation, we can ``by hand'' rule out the kinds of problematic disks which would interfere with the arguments of Gromov-compactness.
\input{def_heegaardFloerDomain}
\input{def_periodicHeegaardFloerDomain}
    Every periodic domain can be represented by a surface with boundary $\hat D\to \Sigma$, thus every periodic domain $\mathcal D$ gives a homology class $H_2(M; \ZZ)$ by gluing the attaching disks associated to each of the $\alpha_i, \beta_j$ to the appropriate boundaries in $\hat D$. We call this homology class $H(\mathcal D)$.
\input{def_weaklyAdmissibleHeegaardDiagram}
The following lemma may give us some intuition for where the admissibility condition enters into the definition of Heegaard-Floer cohomology.
\input{lem_heegaardAdmissibleZeroArea}
\input{lem_heegaardAdmissibleFiniteStrips}
This shows that the symplectic energy of the holomorphic strips that we consider in the definition of the differential $d_z$ is bounded.

    Let $H: \hat X\to \RR$ be a Hamiltonian which on the symplectization takes the form of $h(\exp(r))$. 
    Let $\gamma_+, \gamma_-$ be time 1 orbits of $V_{H_{t}}$. For a contact type almost complex structure, every solution $u: \RR\times S^1\to \hat X$ of the Floer equation with ends limiting to $\gamma_+, \gamma_-$ has image contained in the subset $\hat X|_{\exp(r)\leq C}$, where $C$ is the maximum value of $\exp(r)$ on the orbits $\gamma_+, \gamma_-$.

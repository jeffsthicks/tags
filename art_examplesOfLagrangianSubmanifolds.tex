For symplectic surfaces, we have a complete classification of the Lagrangian submanifolds. 
\input{exm_curvelagrangian}
Some Lagrangian submanifolds can be constructed easily from Lagrangian submanifolds in lower dimensions.
\input{exm_productTorus}
We will later see that  $T^*Q$ gives a local model of a symplectic manifold. For this reason, Lagrangian submanifolds of $T^*Q$  serve as local models for Lagrangian submanifolds in general $X$.
\input{exm_lagrangianInCotangent}
\input{prf_lagrangianInCotangent}
In the setting of cotangent bundles we can also build local models for the intersections of Lagrangian submanifolds.

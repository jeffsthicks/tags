Let $\mathcal C$ be an $A_\infty$ category. A twisted complex $(E, \delta_E)$ consists of:
\begin{itemize}
\item $E$, a formal direct sum of shifts of objects
\[E:=\bigoplus_{i=1}^N E_i[k_i]\]
where $E_{i}\in Ob(\mathcal C)$, and $k_i\in \ZZ$.
\item  A differential $\delta_E$, which can be written as a matrix  of degree 1 maps
\[\delta^{ij}_E: E_i[k_i]\to E_j[k_j +1] .\] These maps must satisfy the following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the matrix $\delta_E$ is strictly upper triangular and;
    \item They satisfy the Maurer-Cartan relation:
    \[\sum_{k\geq 1} m^k (\delta_E\otimes\cdots \otimes \delta_E) =0.\]
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

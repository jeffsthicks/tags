    Let $\CC^*$ be equipped with the symplectic form $\omega=\frac{1}{2\pi} d(\log r) \wedge d\theta$. 
    Let $L_r$ be the Lagrangian  
        \[L_r:=\{z \text{ such that } \log|z|=r\}.\]
    Let $\li_r:L\times [r_0, r_1]\to X$ be the isotopy between $L_{r_0}$ and $L_{r_1}$. 
    Let $e\in H_1(L_r)$ be the fundamental class of $L$. 
    The amount of flux swept out between these two Lagrangian submanifolds is given by the difference of their $r$-values. 
    \[\Flux_{i_r}(e)=\int_{S^1} \int_{r_0}^{r^1} \frac{1}{2\pi} d(\log |z|)\wedge d\theta = r_1-r_0.\]
    For this reason, the value $r$ is sometimes called the ``flux coordinate'' of the fibration $\CC^*\to \RR$.
    The flux class therefore provides a nice parameterization of the space of Lagrangian submanifolds in this example.

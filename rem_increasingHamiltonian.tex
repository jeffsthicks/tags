   \label{rem:increasingHamiltonian}
    If we take $h: \RR_{\geq 0}\to \RR$ a function with slope increasing to infinity the Hamiltonian $H:=h(\exp(r)): X\times \RR\to \RR$ our Hamiltonian vector field is related to the linear Hamiltonian vector fields by  
    \[V_H = h'(\exp(r)) V_{H^1}\]
    Therefore, the time-one Hamiltonian orbits contained in the level set $\exp(r)\times M$ will compute the $h'(\exp(r))$-period Reeb orbits of $V_\alpha$.

    Consider the 3-sphere
    \[M=S^3=\{(x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3)\st x_i\in \RR, \sum_{i=1}^3 x_i^2=1.\]
    Consider the decomposition of this into two halves along the $z_0$ coordinate:
    \begin{align*}
        U_1=\{(x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3)\in S^3 \st x_0\leq 0\}&& U_2=\{(x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3)\in S^3 \st x_0\geq 0\}
    \end{align*}
    Then both $U_1, U_2$ are diffeomorphic to the 3-ball, and are glued together by their common boundary $S^2=\Sigma_0$.

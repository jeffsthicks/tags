A handlebody is a 3-manifold $U$ with boundary with a collection disks $\{f_i: D^2\to U\}_{i=1}^g$ which are embedded and disjoint, so that $U\setminus \bigcup_{i=1}^g \Im(f_i)=D^3$.

To determine the data of a Heegaard splitting, one must specify the data of two fillings of $\Sigma_g$ by handlebodies. When the Heegaard splitting is determined by a self-indexing Morse function $f: M\to \RR$, we can use the critical points to determine the fillings $U_1$ and $U_2$ based on data contained in $\Sigma_g$. The filling $U_1$ is constructed by considering how the downward flow spaces of the critical points of $f|_{U_1}$ attach to the $\Sigma_g$. We may additionally assume  that $f$ has a unique maximum; then to determine the filling we only need to consider how $W^\downarrow(p)$ intersects $\Sigma_g$ for $\{p\in \Crit(f), \ind(p)=1\}$. Furthermore, there are $g$ such critical points which we enumerate as $\{p_i\}_{i=1}^g$. These downward flow spaces are 2-dimensional, so $\{\Sigma_g\cap W^\downarrow(p_i)\}_{i=1}^g$ gives $g$ disjoint cycles in $\Sigma_g$. We call these cycles 
\[\{\alpha_i\}_{i=1}^g:=\{ W^\downarrow(p_i)\cap \Sigma_g\}_{p_i\in \Crit(f), \ind(p_i)=1}\]
Similarly, we can consider the index 2 critical points of $f$, which are all contained in $U_2$, and look at their upward flow spaces
\[\{\beta\}_{i=1}^g:=\{ W^\uparrow(p_i)\cap \Sigma_g\}_{p_i\in \Crit(f), \ind(p_i)=1}.\]

We will usually write $\underline \alpha, \underline \beta$ for $\{\alpha_i\}_{i=1}^g, \{\beta_i\}_{i=1}^g$.

Every Heegaard diagram specifies a 3-manifold, however a single 3-manifold can have many different presentations with different Heegaard diagrams. We have already seen 2 different Heegaard diagrams for $S^3$ in \cref{exm:heegaardSplitting} and  \cref{exm:heegaardDiagram3sphere}. 
Therefore, if we are to study 3-manifolds via their Heegaard diagram, we need to understand when two diagrams give presentations of the same manifold. We first describe some operations which modify a Heegaard diagram, but produce the same 3-manifold.

It follows that in order to construct 3-manifold invariants, one needs to find  quantities associated to the Heegaard diagram which are invariant under stabilizations, isotopies, and handles slides. Heegaard-Floer cohomology provides such an invariant.

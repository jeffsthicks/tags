\input{def_symmetricProduct}
In general, the symmetric product of a manifold does not have the structure of a manifold (as the symmetric group does not act freely on the diagonal). However, when $X$ is a complex curve (real surface) we are able to equip $\Sym^k(X)$ with the structure of a smooth complex manifold.

While $\Sym^k(\Sigma)$ is a complex manifold it \emph{does not} come with a canonical choice of symplectic structure, so we are leaving some of the tools that we use to study Lagrangian intersection Floer cohomology behind.

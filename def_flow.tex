    Given a time-dependent vector field $V_t$,  the \emph{flow associated to $V$} is the function $\phi_t: X\times \RR\to X$ which
    \begin{itemize}
        \item for all $t$, $\phi_t:X\to X$ is a diffeomorphisms and;
        \item is the identity at time 0 so that $\phi_0=\operatorname{id}_M$ and;
        \item generates the vector field $V_t$ in the sense that 
            \[(V_t)_p:=\frac{d}{ds}\phi_s(\phi^{-1}_t(p))|_{s=t}.\]
    \end{itemize}
    We say that \emph{$ V_t$ is the infinitesimal generator} associated to $\phi_t$.

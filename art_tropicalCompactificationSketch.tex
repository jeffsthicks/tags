Note that we have some ideas of compactification already: after all we can define tropical polynomials on $\RR^n$, and $\TT^n$ is a compactification of $\RR^n$.
The space $\TT^n$ has a decomposition into pieces $\RR_I$, which we call the torus orbits. The key notion that we will need to study is how many ``-'infinity'''s does a point $x$ belong to. 
\input{def_sedentarity}
We say that $\sigma\in \TT^n$ is a polyhedron if it is the closure of a polyhedron in one of the torus orbits of $\TT^n$. 
From these compact pieces, we can define a tropical variety: a locally open subset of polyhedra satisfying a balancing condition.

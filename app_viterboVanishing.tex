\begin{application}
 \label{app:viterboVanishing}
    We now look at an application of Viterbo's theorem.
    Let $X$ be a Liouville domain, and suppose that there exists $L\subset X$ an exact Lagrangian submanifold. Then a Weinstein neighborhood $B^*L\subset X$ provides an example of a Liouville subdomain. We therefore have a unital ring homomorphism $\SH(X)\to \SH(B^*L)$. Since the latter is isomorphic (as a vector space) to $H_\bullet(\mathcal L)$, it is non-vanishing. Since a unital ring homomorphism to a non-trivial target cannot have trivial domain, we conclude that $\SH(X)$ is non-vanishing.

    This application is more striking in the reverse direction. Let $X$ be a Liouville domain with vanishing symplectic cohomology (for instance, a subcritical Stein domain). Then $X$ contains no exact Lagrangian submanifolds.

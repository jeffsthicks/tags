    Let $\li_t:L\times \RR\to X$ be a parameterization of the submanifold $K$.
    By reparameterization, it suffices to check that this is a Lagrangian submanifold at points $(p, 0)$. 
    The tangent space $T_{(p, 0)}(L\times \RR)$ is spanned by vectors $\{\partial_{x_1}, \ldots, \partial_{x_{n-1}}, \partial_t\}$. 
    Because $L$ is a Lagrangian of the fiber, and the fiber is a symplectic submanifold,
    \[\li_t^*\omega(\partial_{x_i}, \partial_{x_j})=0.\]
    Since $K$ was constructed via parallel transport, $(\li_t)_*\partial_t\in (\ker(\pi_*))^{\omega\bot}$. Since $L$ is a Lagrangian of the fiber, $(\li_t)_*\partial_{x_i}\in \ker(\pi_*)$.
    Therefore, 
    \begin{align*}\li_t^*\omega(\partial_{x_i}, \partial_{t})=0
    \end{align*}

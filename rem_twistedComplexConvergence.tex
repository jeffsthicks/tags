The condition that the matrix $\delta_E$ is strictly upper triangular is to ensure that the sum in the Maurer-Cartan relation converges. One can also ask that there exists a filtration on $E$, the formal direct sum of shifts of objects, and that the differential $\delta_E$ respects the filtration (see Section 31 of \cite{seidel2008fukaya}). From this perspective, the twisted complex looks more like a formal deformation of the direct sum.

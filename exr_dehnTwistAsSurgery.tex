Consider the space $T^*S^n$ which we describe as a symplectic submanifold of $T^*S^n$ by the equation
\[\{(x_0, \ldots, x_n), (p_0, \ldots, p_n) \st \sum_{i} (x_i+\sqrt{-1} p_i)^2=1 \}\]
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Consider the Hamiltonian given by $H=|\vec p|^2$. Write down the Hamiltonian vector field on $T^*S^n$, and compute its time-one flow.
    \item Consider now the symplectic manifold with boundary 
    \[B^*_1S^n=\{(x_0, \ldots, x_n), (p_0, \ldots, p_n) \st\vec x\cdot \vec p =0,|\vec x|=1, |\vec p|<1\}.\]
    Show that $\phi_{2\pi}: B^*_1S^n\to B^*_1 S^n$, the time-1 Hamiltonian flow of $|\vec p|^2$, acts by  $-1$ on the boundary of $B^*_1S^n$. 
    \item The symplectic Dehn twist is the map: 
    \begin{align*}
        \tau^n: B^*_1 S^n\to& B^*_1 S^n\\
            (\vec x, \vec p) \mapsto& -\phi_{\pi}(\vec x, \vec p).
    \end{align*}
    which fixes the boundary of $B^*_1 S^n$.
    Consider the Lagrangian submanifold  
    \[F_q:=\{(1, \ldots, 0), (0, p_1, \ldots, p_n)\}\subset B^*_1S^n.\]
    Show that there is a Hamiltonian isotopy which identifies
    \[\tau_n(F_q)\sim S^n\# F_q.\]
    \item Consider in $T^2$ the Lagrangian submanifold $L:=L_{(1, 0),0}$ as before. Identify a small neighborhood $U$ of $L$ with $B^*_1(S^1)$, and define\footnote{This does not quite give a smooth map, but it can be made smooth by slightly modifying the definition of $\tau^n$.} $\tau_L: T^2\to T^2$ by 
    \[\tau_L(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc} \tau^1(x) &\text{if $x\in U$}\\
        x &\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]
    For $a, b\in \ZZ$, and $\theta\in S^1$, find the Lagrangian submanifold $L_{(a', b'), \theta'}$ which is Hamiltonian isotopic to  $\tau_L(L_{(a, b), \theta})$.
\end{enumerate}

 A \emph{symplectic vector space} is a $2n$-dimensional vector space $V$, along with a choice of symplectic form $\omega: V\times V\to \RR$ which is an antisymmetric and satisfies any of the following equivalent non-degeneracy conditions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $v \in V$ is the zero vector if and only if $\iota_v\omega=0$,
    \item The symplectic form gives an isomorphism between $V$ and its dual:
    \begin{align*}
        \omega:V\to V^* &&
        v\mapsto \iota_v\omega,
    \end{align*}
    \item The top form $\omega^{n}$ is non-zero.
\end{itemize}

 \label{rem:homologyIncludesIntoSH}
Note here that the proposition has a slightly different degree convention than the one in \cite{seidel2006biased}; this is because we choose our grading on symplectic cohomology to be $\deg(\gamma)=n-CZ(\gamma)$. The Hamiltonian is increasing at infinity; this means that this is a valid choice of Morse function for computing the Morse cohomology of $X$.

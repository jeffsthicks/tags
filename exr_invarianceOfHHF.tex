        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Consider the ``decatigorification" of $\widehat{HHF}^\bullet$ given by the Euler characteristic as described in the previous question. Show that it is invariant under Heegaard moves. How might the proof of invariance of $\widehat{HHF}^\bullet$ differ?
        \item  Suppose $Y_1,Y_2$ are $3$-manifolds. How are $\widehat{HHF}^\bullet(Y_1\# Y_2),\widehat{HHF}^\bullet(Y_1),$ and $\widehat{HHF}^\bullet(Y_2)$ related?
    \item Show that $\widehat{HHF}^\bullet$ is invariant under stabilization and Hamiltonian isotopy in the sense that the resulting groups are isomorphic.
        \end{enumerate}

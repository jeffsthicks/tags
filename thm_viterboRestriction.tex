    \label{thm:viterboRestriction}
    Let $X_0\subset X$ be a Liouville subdomain. Then there is a restriction map $\SH(X)\to \SH(X_0)$, which is a unital ring homomorphism. Furthermore, we have a commutative diagram
    \input{dig_viterboRestriction}
    where the horizontal maps are given by \cref{prp:homologyIncludesIntoSH}.

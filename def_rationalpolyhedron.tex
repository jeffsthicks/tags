    We say that $\sigma\subset \RR^n$ is a \emph{rational polyhedron} if $\sigma = \bigcap_{i\in I} H_{\underline \phi_i}$ for some collection of integral affine functions.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We say that it is a cone  if a translate of it is closed under multiplication by $\RR_{\geq 0}$
        \item We say that $\sigma$ is a polytope if it is compact. 
    \end{itemize}

    We first show that $\ker(\pi_*)$ is a symplectic subspace. 
    Let $0\neq v\in \ker(\pi_*)$ be any tangent vector.
    Since $\pi_*$ is $J$-holomorphic, $Jv\in \ker(\pi_*)$. 
    We conclude that $\omega(v, Jv)=g(v, v)\neq 0$, and so $\omega$ is non-degenerate on the subspace $\ker(\pi_*)=T_zX$. 
    It remains to show that the form is closed. 
    Let $i:X_z\into X$ be and inclusion of a fiber of the Lefschetz fibration.
    Then $di^*\omega= i^*d\omega =0$, so the $\omega|_{X_z}$ is a symplectic form on the fiber. 

    We can construct a connection by picking a horizontal complement to the kernel of the projection. 
    As $\ker(\pi_*)$ is a symplectic subspace, $(\ker(\pi_*))^{\omega\bot}$, its symplectic complement, is a complementary subspace in the sense that $\ker(\pi_*)\oplus (\ker(\pi_*))^{\omega\bot}=TX$. 
    This is a choice of horizontal complement, defining a connection on this fiber bundle. 
    In fact, the splitting of the tangent bundle locally splits the symplectic form.

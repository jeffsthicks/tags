    Here, $\CF(S, L)\otimes S$ is a twisted complex. Recall that (as a vector space) $\CF(S, L)=\bigoplus_{x\in S\cap L} \Lambda\langle x \rangle$. 
    The twisted complex $\CF(S, L)\otimes S$ is given by $\bigoplus_{x\in S\cap L} S\langle x \rangle$, which is to say that formal direct sum of copies of $S$ whose grading is determined by the intersection points $x$.
    The differential on a twisted complex is a collection of maps $\delta_{xy}^E\\in \CF(S\langle x \rangle, S\langle y \rangle)$. The morphism we take is 
    \[\delta_{xy}^E= \langle m^1(x), y\rangle \id.\]
    
    We describe the map $\ev: \CF(S, L)\otimes S\to L$. Recall that a morphism of twisted complexes is a collection of maps. We must pick for each $S\langle x \rangle$ a morphism in $\hom(S\langle x \rangle , L)$. Fortunately, there is a canonical choice (which is $x$ itself).

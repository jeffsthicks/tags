\begin{application}
\label{app:weinsteinConjecture}
We look at an application of \cref{prp:homologyIncludesIntoSH}. 
Let $X$ be a Liouville domain, and suppose that $(\partial X, \alpha)$ has no Reeb orbits. Then the map from \cref{prp:homologyIncludesIntoSH} is an isomorphism 
\[H^\bullet(X)\to \SH(X).\]
Therefore, we can compute $\SH(X)$ to show that $(\partial X)$ has a Reeb orbit.  

\input{exm_SHofBall}

A generalization of this result (due to \cite{oancea2003suite}) states that whenever $X$ is a Stein domain (\cref{exm:steinDomain}) is subcritical (so the Morse indexes of the critical points of $\phi: X\to \RR$ are all less than $n$) then $\SH(X)=0$.

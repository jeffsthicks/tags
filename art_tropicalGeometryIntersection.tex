Given $Z_k(\RR^n)$, the set of tropical $k$-cycles, has a group structure, whose additive structure is given by taking unions and subdividing. This also comes with a ring structure 
\begin{align*}
    Z_k(\RR^n)\otimes Z_l(\RR^n)\to \ZZ_{n+l-n}(\RR^n)\\
    X\tensor Y \mapsto \lim_{\epsilon\to 0} (X\cap (T+\eps v))
\end{align*}
where is chose so that the intersection is transverse for all $\epsilon>0$ sufficiently small.

The key step to proving that this ring structure is well defined is the moving lemma. 
\input{lem_movinglemma}
From this information, it is natural to define a tropical version of the Chow group. This means that we need a substitute for rational/algebraic/numerical equivalence.

\input{exm_tropicalrationalfunction}
To a rational function $f$, we associate a tropical $(n-1)$ cycle in $\RR^n$. First, pick a minimal polyhedral subdivision $P$  of $\RR^n$ so that $\psi_\sigma$ is integral affine for every $\sigma\in P$. This is not uniquely determined. Then take the $(n-1)$ skeleton for this polyhedral structure; then assign weights. 
\input{def_tropicalhodgeboundaries}
We then can define :
\begin{align*} 
    CH_k(\RR^n):=Z_k/R_k \\
      CH_k^b(\RR^n):= Z_k/R^b_k
\end{align*}

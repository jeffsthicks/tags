Let $L_0, L_1$ be two Lagrangian submanifolds which intersect transversely at a point, and let $U$ be a neighborhood of the point in which we implant a surgery neck. Suppose two profile curves $\gamma_0, \gamma_1$ have the same flux $\lambda$.
Then there exists a Hamiltonian supported on $U$ whose time one identifies $L_1\#_{\gamma_0} L_2$ and $L_1\#_{\gamma_1} L_2$.

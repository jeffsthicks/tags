    Let $\dim(X)\geq 4$, and $L_1, L_2$ be Lagrangians which intersect transversely at a single point $p_{12}$. Let $L_0$ intersection $L_1, L_2$ transversely. Then for sufficiently small surgery necks, there exists a choice of almost complex structure giving us a bijection between
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $J$-holomorphic strips with boundary on $L_0, L_1\# L_2$ which pass through the surgery neck;
        \item $J$-holomorphic triangles with boundary on $L_0, L_1, L_2$.
    \end{itemize}

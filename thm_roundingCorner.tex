    Let $\dim(X)\geq 4$, and $L_1, L_2$ be exact Lagrangian submanifolds which intersect transversely at a single point $p_{12}$. Let $L_0$ be another exact Lagrangian submanifold which intersects $L_1, L_2$ transversely. Then for sufficiently small surgery necks, there exists a choices of almost complex structure on $X$ for which we have a bijection between
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $J$-holomorphic strips with boundary on $L_0, L_1\# L_2$ which pass through the surgery neck;
        \item $J$-holomorphic triangles with boundary on $L_0, L_1, L_2$.
    \end{itemize}

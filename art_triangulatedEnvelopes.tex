We have no expectation that the geometric Fukaya category $\Fuk(X)$ is triangulated: indeed, it is only guaranteed that the category is \emph{pre-additive}. Never-the-less, we would like to say that $\Fuk(X$) can be enhanced to a triangulated category.
There are general constructions which enlarge an $A_\infty$ category $\mathcal C$ to a triangulated category. These constructions rely on the fact that the $A_\infty$ structure on $\mathcal C$ already knows what its exact triangles should be. 

We give two enlargements: the category of modules over $\mathcal C$, or the category of twisted complexes. These notes are based on Chapter 3 of \cite{seidel2008fukaya}.

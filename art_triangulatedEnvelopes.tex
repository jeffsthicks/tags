We have no expectation that the geometric Fukaya category $\Fuk(X)$ is triangulated: indeed, it is only guaranteed that the category is \emph{pre-additive}. We would additionally like to say that the choices of triangles in the category are somehow determined by $\Fuk(X)$, and do not need to be added in by hand. 
Fortunately for us, there are several general constructions which enlarge an $A_\infty$ category $\mathcal C$ to a triangulated category. These constructions rely on the fact that the $A_\infty$ structure on $\mathcal C$ already knows what its exact triangles should be. 

We give two enlargements: the category of modules over $\mathcal C$, or the category of twisted complexes.

Unfortunately, the $\text{Mod}-\mathcal C$ construction is too big.  There is a milder operation called \emph{twisted complexes} which we can use to enlarge the Fukaya category.

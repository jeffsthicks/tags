    Let $X$ be a manifold. Let $Y$ be a compact submanifold of $X$. 
    Let $\omega_0,  \omega_1$ be symplectic forms on $Y$ such that $\omega_0(p)=\omega_1(p)$ for all $p\in X$.
    Then there exists neighborhoods $U_0,  U_1\supset X$ and a symplectomorphism $\phi:(U_0,  \omega_0)\to (U_1,  \omega_1)$ such that $\phi(p)=p$ for all $p\in X$.
